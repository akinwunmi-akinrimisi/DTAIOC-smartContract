Paymaster Implementation Guide for DTriviaAIOnChain
1. Overview
This guide outlines the integration of a Biconomy Verifying Paymaster to sponsor all gas fees for the DTriviaAIOnChain dApp on Base Sepolia, ensuring a gasless experience for all user and admin interactions.
2. Scope

User Actions: Subsidize createGame, joinGame, submitAnswers, mint.
Admin Actions: Subsidize advanceStage, refundPlayer, endGame, autoEndGame, setBackendSigner, pauseMinting, unpauseMinting, pauseStaking, unpauseStaking, setGameContract.
Platform: Biconomy Verifying Paymaster and Gasless SDK on Base Sepolia.
Conditions: Validate Basenames for user actions; allow all valid contract calls.

3. Steps

Register Paymaster:
Sign up on Biconomy Dashboard, select Base Sepolia, create Verifying Paymaster.
Add contract addresses (DTAIOCGame, DTAIOCToken, DTAIOCStaking, DTAIOCNFT).


Fund Paymaster:
Deposit ETH from platformAddress via Dashboard or EntryPoint.depositTo.


Configure Sponsorship:
Validate Basenames via MockBasenameResolver.sol.
Check callData for valid contracts and functions.
Use Biconomy’s signature-based validation.


Integrate Frontend:
Install @biconomy/gasless-sdk.
Construct UserOps for all actions, include Paymaster address in paymasterAndData.
Support Smart Wallets (Safe, Argent) and MetaMask.


Security:
Validate Basenames and signatures.
Use ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, and pause functionality.


Testing:
Test gasless execution for all actions using Hardhat and Biconomy SDK.
Validate edge cases (invalid Basename, low Paymaster funds).



4. Best Practices

Security: Restrict sponsorship to valid contracts, use signatures.
Efficiency: Leverage Biconomy’s gas optimization, minimize storage writes.
Monitoring: Use Biconomy Dashboard to track gas usage and balance.

5. Deployment

Deploy existing contracts (DTAIOCToken, DTAIOCNFT, DTAIOCStaking, DTAIOCGame).
Configure and fund Biconomy Paymaster.
Integrate Gasless SDK in React frontend.
Test on Base Sepolia using BaseScan.
